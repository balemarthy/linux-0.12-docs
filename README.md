# Linux 0.12 Documentation
This repository aims to provide detailed documentation and explanations for the Linux kernel version 0.12. Each file is documented with Doxygen comments, and there are comprehensive README files explaining the internals and workings of the kernel.

## Project Overview

The Linux 0.12 kernel is an early version of the Linux operating system. This documentation project seeks to explain its inner workings in detail, making it easier for enthusiasts, students, and developers to understand its architecture and functionality.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to different sections of the kernel:

- **boot/**: Bootloader code and initial setup.
- **kernel/**: Core kernel code.
- **mm/**: Memory management.
- **fs/**: File system.
- **include/**: Header files.
- **lib/**: Utility functions.
- **tools/**: Tools and scripts.
- **doc/**: Additional documentation and guides.

Each directory contains a `README.md` file that provides an overview of the files in that directory and detailed explanations where necessary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and generate the documentation, you will need:
- Doxygen

### Generating Documentation

To generate the documentation using Doxygen, run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
```sh
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs` directory.
